	<Historical descripiton>The rice terraces of the cordilleras are one of the few monuments in the phillipines that show no evidence of having been influenced by colonial cultures. Owing to the diffulcult terrain, the cordilleras tribes are among the few peoples of the phillipines who have successfully resisted any foreign domination and have preserved their authenic tribal culture.
Apart from the idjang stone-fortresses of the Ivatan of the Batanes, the terraces, which spread over five present-day provinces, are the only other only form of surviving stone construction from the pre-colonial period. The Philippines alone among south-east Asian cultures is a largely wood-based one: unlike Cambodia, Indonesia, or Thailand, for example, in the Philippines both domestic buildings and ritual structures such as temples and shrines were all built in wood, a tradition that has survived in the terrace hamlets.	
It is believed that terracing began in the Cordilleras less than one thousand years ago as Taro cultivation. It is evidence of a high level of knowledge of structural and hydraulic engineering on the part of the Ifugao builders. The knowledge and practices, supported by rituals, involved in maintaining the terraces are transferred orally from generation to generation, without written records. Taro was later replaced by rice around 1600 A.D. which is the predominant crop today.

	<h2>Location</h2>
If you find yourself in the Philippines, this journey is definitely worth the effort (and it can feel like an effort with a minimum 18-hour round trip on broken roads from Manila). Here’s my guide to visiting the Batad rice terraces.
